    "longdesc" : "Nekbone captures the basic structure and user interface of the ex- tensive Nek5000 software. Nek5000 is a high order, incompressible Navier-Stokes solver based on the spectral element method. It has a wide range of applications and intricate customizations available to users. Nekbone, on the other hand, solves a Helmholtz equation in a box, using the spectral element method. It is pared down to include only the necessary features to compile, run, and solve the applications found in the test/ directory. Since almost all prac- tical applications are in the three dimensional space, the solver is set to work with three dimensional geometries as default. Nekbone solves a standard Poisson equation using a conjugate gradient it- eration with a simple or spectral element multigrid preconditioner on a block or linear geometry (parameters are set within the test directory of the simulation). Nekbone exposes the principal compu- tational kernel to reveal the essential elements of the algorithmic- architectural coupling that is pertinent to Nek5000."
