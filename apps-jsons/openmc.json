    "shortdesc" : "The OpenMC project aims to provide a fully-featured Monte Carlo particle transport code based on modern methods. It is a constructive solid geometry, continuous-energy transport code that uses ACE format cross sections.",
    "longdesc" : "This release of OpenMC includes a few new major features including the capability to perform neutron transport with multi-group cross section data as well as experimental support for the windowed multipole method being developed at MIT. Source sampling options have also been expanded significantly, with the option to supply arbitrary tabular and discrete distributions for energy, angle, and spatial coordinates."
